# Spatial-Detection-of-Slums-in-Dhaka
This project identifies slum areas in Dhaka using unsupervised machine learning on satellite images. Key steps:  Preprocessing: Extracts features like building density, texture, and vegetation using OpenCV and GLCM  Clustering: Uses K-Means to group similar regions (slums vs. non-slums)  Visualization: Generates heatmaps
